WHY

Is not the why as in the deep purpose of the company but how the task aligns to those objectives. It answers the question “Why are you doing this?”, “What’s the value of this?”, “What potential action is going to change or generate?” or “What decision is going to change?”. It’s mostly made in parallel with the WHAT, and although is the less impactful task in terms of deliverable, is key for efficiency as it helps to maximize the amount of analysis not done, and narrow down the results.

WHAT

Is the actual deliverable / result the analysis is going to have. Always starts as a high level description, but is a good practice to make a mock up as detailed as possible. A clear picture of the result gives clarity to the How and also set expectations to stakeholders.

HOW

It’s the point where the analysis is planned and the milestones to reach the results defined. Is the place to find the overview of all the process. Given it’s where the process is going to be stored, each iteration needs to be written down.

Ways to expand or narrow down are:

Methods Hypothesis Extension or scope of the analyis

SO WHAT

Complete after the analysis is finished with some recommendation on actionables for Product, iterations of the analysis or a recommendation to stop exploring around this topic
